# Download Youtube Videos
tool made for myself to improve good practices and to download my favorite videos easy

## Set Up and launch
´´´
python -m venv env
.env/Scripts/activate # windows
source .env/bin/activate #
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
´´´

## what I have done
By now is an easy function, just add the url and click download, it will download the video in max resolution in the folder that you have the program

### future improvements
decide where you want to download
show data of video before download
direct default download
decide quality / format
decide video or audio
change tkinter, too ugly
