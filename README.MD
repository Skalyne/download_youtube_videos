# Download Youtube Videos
tool made for myself to improve good practices and to download my favorite videos easy

## Set Up and launch
´´´
python -m venv env
.env/Scripts/activate # windows
source .env/bin/activate #
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
´´´

## what I have done
By now is an easy function, just add the url and click download, it will download the video in max resolution in the folder that you have the program

### Added
#### download file in selected folder
Now you can choose where you want to download your video, if you don´t choose a file directory, it will be downloaded in the program root directory

### future improvements
show data of video before download
direct default download
decide quality / format
decide video or audio
change tkinter, too ugly
